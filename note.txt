======================================================
TO-DO
    Implement permission request denied
    Implement suggestion denied
    Consensus on accepted id and value
    More examples and test cases
======================================================

Thought process:

Setup:
    1 server
    2 clients

Choose Server to be Suggester to trigger request/suggestion and also Arbiter to collect accepted message
2 Clients will be Voters

To make sure that clients to all clients, must keep a list of clients

Message Protocol:
    SUGGESTION_(1,'A')_'Foo'
    SUGGESTION-DENIED_(2,'E')
    PERMISSION-GRANTED_(3,'A')_(3,'A')_'Foo'
    PERMISSION-DENIED_(3,'A')
    PERMISSION-REQUEST_(3,'A')
    ACCEPTED_(3,'A')

    Split data with '_'
    If new_data[0] == X1 do Y1

How it works:
    Let Server keep a list of all Clients to broadcast message
        The way Server do that depend how we want to set it up
            Server will stay there and listen
            When receive "READY" from all Clients, we are ready for next step

    Server send Permission Request (Permitted ID) to all Clients
        When Client receive Permission Request,
            If that Permitted ID > Client's Permitted ID:
                Update Client's permitted ID
                Send back PERMISSION-GRANTED_(3,'A')_(3,'A')_'Foo'
            Otherwise, send back PERMISSION-DENIED_(3,'A')

        If Server receive a PERMISSION-DENIED_(3,'A')
            Server send back PERMISSION-REQUEST_(4,'A')
